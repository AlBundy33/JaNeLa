# The Java Network Launch Analyzer

JaNeLa was developed by Andrew Thompson and was available at http://pscode.org/janela/
Unfortunately the site is down and source is hard to find.
Luckily I've found the sources here: https://community.oracle.com/thread/1305583

Because it was published under LGPL I've decided to add my own checks and make it available an github.
